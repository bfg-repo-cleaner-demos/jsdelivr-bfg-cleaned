Free CDN jsDelivr
========

http://www.jsdelivr.com

This repo was created to allow the community to make modifications and improve the contents of jsDelivr's CDN.

Feel free to open issues and pull requests if you think something should be added/removed/modified.

I am also working on a closer integration of github with the jsdelivr.com website.
